    "This notebook is broken down into 5 exercises, each of which have either one or more questions\n",
    "for you to answer. You should answer in the boxes provided.  Some questions require you to write\n",
    "code and make plots, include these in the code boxes. Some question require text and this should\n",
    "be written in the markdown boxes (use the dropdown menu at the top to switch between formats)\n",

    "## Outline:\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to familiarise yourself with scaling relationships in earthquake\n",
    "seismology, and to understand the difference between Gaussian and Possonian distributions applied\n",
    "to long-term earthquake hazard forecasting.\n",
