    "# Intro to Obspy\n",
    "\n",
    "Obspy is a Python package for seismology. It contains a wide range of tools, from fundamental input/output (IO) functions, up to higher\n",
    "level functions including noise analysis, beamforming and wrappers for travel-time calculations.  Obspy has rapidly gained popularity,\n",
    "as of February 2019, Obspy version 1.1.0 had been installed from conda-forge 11,720 times in the 3 months that it was the current version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",

    "\n",
    "Python as a language is widely used, both within the scientific community and in more applied work. It is also open-source, meaning that\n",
    "the licence limitations of something like Matlab are not an issue.  Because Python is widely used there are some fantastic libraries,\n",
    "meaning that you do not need to re-invent the wheel - someone has probably solved your problem already - meaning you can focus on\n",
    "doing science. Furthermore, because Python is used beyond academia, it is a useful, transferable language to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, meaning that you do not need to actively compile code to machine code before executing your core\n",
    "(unlike languages like C or Fortran). This means that you can rapidly test short ideas, and allows us to make use of things like\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks and the iPython interpretter.  In general interpreted languages are slower than compilled languages, and this\n",
    "is generally true for Python as well.  However, because Python is simple to extend with compiled languages (particularly C), Python\n",
    "provide a good *glue* between faster code components.  It is normal to convert time-critical sections of code to C and link these\n",
    "to a Python library. Numpy makes good use of this, and links some very fast compiled maths libraries (LAPACK and BLAS) in to Python.\n",

    "Obspy is actively maintained, developed and tested by an international group of seismologists.  Obspy also implements a good \n",
    "*continuous integration* workflow, whereby any proposed changes to the package are tested before they are accepted. The complete\n",
    "package is also tested prior to release, ensuring that Obspy does what it is supposed to. This kind of testing is incredibly\n",
    "important, and, while it does not guarantee correctness, it is a very necessary step to test code to ensure that it does what\n",
    "you expect it to.  Obspy also has fairly extensive documentation and good examples and tutorials.\n",

    "Obspy provides a nice plug-in system for reading various seismic data formats.  As part of this\n",

    "data are, you have a good chance of being able to read it.\n",

    "We will try reading in some data from the Data directory which should have come with these notebooks.  The data we will read is a multiplexed miniseed file, which has been compressed using STEIM2 compression.\n",

    "used extensively by data-centres for storing waveform data, and STEIM2 is a form of compression.  The data\n",
    "are from five stations in New Zealand close to the Kaikoura M7.8 earthquake epicenter, and show the seconds\n",
    "before the mainshock and the first arrivals.  The stations use broadband seismometers and suffer\n",
    "from clipping during the Kaikoura wavetrain.  We will plot just the vertical components."
