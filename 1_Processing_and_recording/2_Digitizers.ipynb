    "# Digitizers\n",
    "\n",
    "Digitizers convert analogue data to digital data, this is achieved using an anaglogue-to-digital converter (ADC). Generally seismographs will continiously measure voltage associated with the movement of a mass, or force exerted to keep a mass stationary (in the case of force-balance seismographs). This continuous, analogue voltage is then converted to *counts* by a digitizer and recorded to disk, or transitted via some telemetry system to a data centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main role of the digitizer therefore is to convert analogue voltages to digital counts. The **Nyquist-Shanon sampling theorum** states that: *If a function x(t) contains no frequencies higher than B hertz, it is completely determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced 1/(2B) seconds apart.*\n",
    "It is therefore possible to select a sampling frequency such that continuous data can be recreated by digital data. However, in practice, this idealised sampling frequency is rarely used in seismology due to the possible range of frequencies generated by earthquakes or other seismic sources coupled with the long-durations of recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the idea of a **Nyquist frequency**. This is the minimum rate at which a signal can be sampled without introducing errors, which is twice the highest frequency present in the signal. Thus, if you want to faithfully represent data up to 50Hz you must sample your data at at-least 100Hz (or a sample interval of 0.01s). This is a common sampling rate for regional earthquake seismology. We will think about how the frequency content of earthquake waveforms changes with distance when we think about attenuation."
