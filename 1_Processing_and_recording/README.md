# Introduction to processing and recording seismic data for observational earthquake seismology.

These notebooks are designed to give you a *hands-on* way to play with some of the concepts we
have covered in lectures or in your reading. The table below provides recommended reading to
go with the notebooks.

This course will make heavy use of the Obspy Python package.  Obspy provides Pythonic ways of working
with seismic data, including:
- Reading and writing a variety of seismic, event and station data;
- Filtering, resampling, instrument response correction, etc. of seismic data;
- Plotting of seismic data;
- Mapping of event and station data;
- And much more...

We will only make use of a small subset of Obspy's functionality, so the introduction in this course
if limited to introduce you to the key concepts of Obspy rather than providing an extensive tutorial.
The [obspy documentation](https://docs.obspy.org/), [tutorial](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/) 
and obspy section of the [seismo-live notebooks](http://krischer.github.io/seismo_live/) provide
further examples and information for use.
