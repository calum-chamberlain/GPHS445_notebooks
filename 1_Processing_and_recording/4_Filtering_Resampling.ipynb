    "## How filters work\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters work to remove energy at certain frequencies. This involves convolving some filter series with your data. In the time domain, convolution can be\n",
    "a slow process, however, in the frequency domain, convolutions are simple multiplications. Because multiplication is a less computationally\n",

    "\n",
    "First we will set up a few functions that:\n",
    "1. Design a filter in the frequency domain using scipy's \n",
    "   [iirfilter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.iirfilter.html#scipy.signal.iirfilter) function.\n",
    "2. Apply the filter and plot the results in the time and frequency domains.\n",

    "[second-order sections](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.sosfilt.html#scipy.signal.sosfilt)\n",
