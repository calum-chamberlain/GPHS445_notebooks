    "## How to use this notebook:\n",
    "The notebook is broken down into five exercises.  Within each exercise are explanatory\n",
    "sections of text, and code. Sections that require a response will begin with: **Question:** \n",
    "and an empty box will follow.  Sometimes these will require a textual response, sometimes\n",
    "code will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline:\n",
    "In this assignment you will apply your knowledge to generate your own catalog of earthquakes\n",
    "in a region you are interested in. You should pick somewhere that has a moderate amount of\n",
    "seismicity (at least 10 earthquakes per day in the GeoNet catalog), and pick a subnetwork\n",
    "of five GeoNet stations to use for your analysis. You should aim to do better than GeoNet, and\n",
    "you should make a comparison of your work to their detections, picks and locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you will consider extended sources and slip parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadlines:\n",
    "Friday 7th June at 5pm by [email](mailto:calum.chamberlain@vuw.ac.nz).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading:\n",
    "This assignment is worth double the previous assignments and will require more work. Give yourself\n",
    "some time and work through the sections as we go through the notebooks in class.\n",
