    "# Focal Mechanisms and Moment Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Focal mechanisms describe slip on a fault arising from a purely double couple source. See Stein and Wysession's Section 4.4 for a\n",
    "discussion of force couples and single forces.Focal mechanisms inherently have ambiguity over which of the two resolved planes\n",
    "is the actual fault plane, and in general additional evidence is required to determine which plane if the fault plane. Focal\n",
    "mechanisms are commonly used to describe the faulting styles in a region, and to invert for principle stress axis orientations.\n",
    "Understanding stress orientations (and magnitude, which cannot be derived from focal mechanism inversion) is becoming useful\n",
    "for understanding the likelihood of induced earthquakes (e.g.: \n",

    "and for understanding how stresses change around slow-slip events (e.g. [Warren-Smith et al., 2019]()) amongst other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First motions\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and most widely used method for estimating focal mechanisms is to evaluate first-motion polarities of P-waves.\n",
    "The `seismic_picker.py` applet has been extended to allow you to pick polarities. Note that this needs to be the first motion\n",
    "polarity, not the polarity of the maximum peak. The wavetrain of an individual seismic phase is a superposition of different\n",
    "ray-paths, which may be of opposite polarities.  Polarities are either compressional (up) or dilatational (down). Waves that\n",
    "show compressive first motions arise when the faults first motion is towards the seismometer (along the ray-path, which may\n",
    "take an *interesting* path to the seismometer). Dilatational waves arise when the faults first motion is away from the seismometer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Once polarities are measured they can be plotted on a stereonet to obtain a scatter of points on the focal sphere. These points can\n",
    "be inverted to obtain a best fitting focal mechanism. Some important things to note are:\n",
    "1. First motion amplitudes tend to zero towards the nodal planes: polarities may be obscured close to nodal planes;\n",
    "2. Polarities are plotted based on take-off angle and azimuth. Both properties require accurate hypocentre locations and\n",
    "   accurate ray-tracing;\n",
    "3. Lower-hemisphere stereonets are commonly used because take-off angles for first arriving rays are often downwards (towards\n",
    "   a faster medium).\n",
