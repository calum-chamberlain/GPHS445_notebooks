# Building a catalog

These notebooks will guide you through some of the fundamental steps in building an earthquake catalog
from digitial seismic data.  You should now be familiar with how seismic data are recorded and some of
the fundamental time-series analysis techniques we can apply to digitial seismic data.  This module
will apply this knowledge and introduce some of the basic earthquake source properties, and how we
glean information on these properties from seismic data.

These notebooks will build to the final assignment, which is to construct your own earthquake catalog for
a region of your choosing.  As usual, these notebooks will be mostly practical, and light on theory.
You should complete the recommended reading (below) alongside these notebooks.
