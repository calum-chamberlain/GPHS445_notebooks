    "\n",
    "[FDSN](https://www.fdsn.org/) stands for Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks, and is an organisation that aims to achieve good geographic seismographic coverage of the globe. Along the way to this goal the FDSN developed several standards which help to archive and distribute seismic data. It is fun to think that seismology was one pf the worlds earliest truely international scientific endeavours: to be able to locate teleseismic earthquakes data from around the world is needed, so from very early on data were shared between institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the FDSN provides a really useful standard for data access through the [FDSN web services](https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/) specifications. You don't need to know the intricacies of this, but feel free to read up if you are interested in data sharing and access! The FDSN specification covers waveform and event data as well as station meta-data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPy implements pythonic ways of accessing FDSN-compliant web-services through their [FDSN client](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/obspy.clients.fdsn.html). One such FDSN-compliant web-service is offered by [GeoNet](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/tools/FDSN), meaning we can look at some NZ data very easily, yay!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start off by instantiating a Client that can access the GeoNet web-service.  You have to instantiate a new client for each different end-point (say you want data from GeoNet and IRIS, you will need to make two Clients)."
