# Seismic waves

The notebooks provide a very limited set of tools to visualise different
waves and arrivals in the Earth ([Introduction to seismic waves](1_Seismic_Waves.ipynb)) and 
visualise refracted waves through simple 1D half-spaces ([Refraction](2_Refraction.ipynb)).

For this module you should read Stein and Wysession, Chapter 2.4-2.8 inclusive: 
Basic Seismological Theory.

Addional reading on ray-tracing: Stein and Wysession 3.5-3.8.
