# Seismic waves

These notebooks should provide some interactive tools to help you understand how seismic waves
are generated, how they interact with discontinuities and how their amplitudes change as they
propogate.  We will use some simplified examples to demonstrate (computationally) some of these
processes.

These notebooks accompany reading from Stein and Wysession, Chapter 2. Some pertinant information
will be repeated here, but these notebooks should not be taken as containing everything you need
to know!
