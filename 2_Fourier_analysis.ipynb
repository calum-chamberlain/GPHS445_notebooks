    "When $s_n$ and $c_n$ are Fourier coefficients, $t$ is time, $a$ is amplitude and $\\omega$ is angular frequency.\n",

    "In seismology we use the Fourier transform to convert from the time domain to the frequency domain. Because we are dealing with digital data (discretely sampled) we make use of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We will often refer to the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) as well, which is an efficient computational\n",
    "implementation of the DFT. The Fourier transform allows us to study the frequencies that make up our seismogram - you will use this in future when computing moment magnitudes and thinking about earthquake source processes.  Over longer time-series we can also look at the the frequencies of various normal modes of the earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common uses for the Fourier transform in seismology is when filtering seismograms.  Filters work as convolutions in the time domain, or multiplications in the frequency domain.  Because multiplication is more computationally efficient than convolution, filtering is commonly (*but not exclusively! - ObsPy filters in the time domain*) done in the frequency domain.  Of key importance here is that we can convert back from the frequency domain to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform (IFT).\n",

    "In this notebook we will look at the Fourier spectrums of a few different signals - we will also play with decimating our data and see what effect this has on the frequency content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Discrete Fourier transforms assume that the data can be **represented by periodic functions**, thus the data that you are transforming is assumed to be periodic and should start and end at the same value to allow wraparound.  One way that we cope with this in seismology is to detrend our data (so that the start and end are zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should always detrend your data before doing any time-frequency conversion.** It can also be helpful to [taper](https://docs.obspy.org/master/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.taper.html) your data to suppress large amplitudes close to the end of traces."

    "When we compute Fourier transforms we obtain a real part and a complex part. The real part is the amplitude spectrum that we have looked at so far, but the complex part describes the phase spectrum. We have not been picky about the phase of our filters thus far, and there are an infinite number of possible causal filters for a single amplitude spectrum. Usually the minimum phase filter is used, which concentrates energy at the front of the time series. The above filters were mixed phase - energy was distributed throughout the time-series.\n",

    "To avoid shifting peaks in the waveform we can use a **zero-phase** filter.  This zero-phase filter is *acausal*: it is symmertical about the origin time and shifts some energy to occur *before* the original signal. Note that this can result in apparently earlier arrivals, you must be careful when applying filters prior to estimating seismic phase arrivals! Zerophase filters can be acheived by running the same filter forwards then backwards.  This has the effect of increasing the order of the final filter (e.g. a 2nd order filter becomes a 4th order filter). \n",
